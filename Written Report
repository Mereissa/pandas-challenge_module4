My analysis of the data is that it shows us each student's math and reading scores from different schools in the same district. 
The school's performance is evaluated by taking into account the different school sizes and budgets.

I noticed while analyzing the data set that Smaller schools have higher passing rates in math and reading compared to a 
larger school that has more students.

While comparing the highest-performing schools and the lowest-performing schools I noticed that the highest-performing 
school had a budget per student of $582 while the lowest-performing school had a budget per student of $637. This tells us 
that having a higher budget per student doesnâ€™t reflect in the student's Overall passing scores.
